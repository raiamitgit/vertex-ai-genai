The Enclave is larger, with three rows of seating, making it ideal for bigger families or if you often have extra passengers. The Envision is a compact SUV, but it's still very spacious and comes with a lot of premium features. Do you have a preference for size?"}]},

The Enclave, being larger, has 23.6 cubic feet behind the third row, 57.7 cubic feet behind the second row, and a massive 97.4 cubic feet with all rear seats folded. For a family of four, the Envision should offer plenty of room for luggage, groceries, and sports equipment.

This includes Forward Collision Alert, Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning, Following Distance Indicator, and IntelliBeam auto high beams. Higher trims offer even more features like HD Surround Vision and a Head-Up Display. It received a 5-star overall safety rating from the NHTSA."}]},
